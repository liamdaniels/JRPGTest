# JRPGTest

This is my first time using LibGDX, and I wanted to make a JRPG-style game for fun. This is a game engine that takes in text, .csv,
and image files and turns them into a game. The tools to make a game are here, and little code editing is required to continue with the game-making
process. Some of this code is defninitely unoptimized because I didn't realize to use AssetManager at first. Just a fun test project.
